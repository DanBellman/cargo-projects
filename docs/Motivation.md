Who is this for? Mainly me, but I think it can be useful for other developers as well who are working on multiple Rust projects locally and who want to keep their development environment organized, especially disk usage. 

My motivation for writing this project: My main workstaion only has 500GB storage and has rather weak compile hardware. I like to create various projects, compile them and leave them just there so I can come back later without compiling. That is especially useful if I work on bevy games and compare different games. At one point I hit my max storage and have to delete some stuff. Most of the time I just forgot which projects I didnt regularly use anymore, and which could be cleaned up by `cargo clean`. But I also forget how painfully long some projects take to compile, so this tool also helps me in managing if I should clean this one project up or not and how frequent I actually used it (or looked at it). 

I hope this tool helps people like me.
